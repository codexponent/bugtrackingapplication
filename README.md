# Bug Tracking Application
--------

Bug Tracking Application is a platform where bug can be tracked, recorded and fixed under some management. There are 3 levels of people inside the application. Tester, Manager and Devleoper. Manager manages all the application top to bottom, developer fixes the bug and tester reports the bug. Manager is allowed to add more than 1 project into the application. The manager also has previlage to add or remove developers or testers. There is also a super admin who watches manager and can take action if only the manager has done some illegal action against the licence of the application. <br />
The application has the Metro Theme so it's really good looking. It is a 2 tire architecture, frontend being the Windows Application Form and the backend being the MSSQL database, application. Here's the link to the demo of the application with respect to all the people (developer, tester and manager). (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4eckHjU9vDr37yPkE80VYUGkPjhnoo7n) <br />
A Real Production Application can be made with this codebase if contributors are there to help. Everybody is welcome!!<br /> <br />
